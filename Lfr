Line follower Robot is a very simple robot that follows a line, either a black line or a white line. These type of robots are very simple to build and is often the first choice for beginners who are getting 
started with robotics. Basically, there are two types of line follower robots: one is a black line follower which follows the black line and the second is a white line follower which follows the white line. 
Line follower actually senses the line and follows it.

Building a Line follower robot using Arduino is interesting. The line follower robot senses a black line by using a sensor and then sends the signal to Arduino. Then Arduino drives the motor according to 
sensors' output.
